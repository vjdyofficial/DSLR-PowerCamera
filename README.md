> [!tip]
> - HD, FHD, and QHD options uses **Upscale/Downscale** feature in **LMC 8.4 **. HD Upscale value is 1x, FHD Upscale Value is 2x, and QHD upscale value is 3x. so, you will have a idea on how these things work.
> - Color Grading will not work on the video, only on the photo. But Leica Vignette effect will work.
> - You don't need expensive DSLR camera If you want to capture very high quality.
> - Do not use this as the document capture, only Portraits, Nature, Scenes, Events, and some sort of Photography. (unless you have to capture the screen that contains correction kit).
> - Night Sight shots are very excellent on this config.
